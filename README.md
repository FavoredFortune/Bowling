## Overview

Welcome to this application that generates bowling games and their final scores.
This means it constructs a game of 2 rolls per frame, for 9 frames and the 10th frame has 3 rolls.
The application will return the final scores of different game scores. Each game calculated will have 10 total frames.

- Regular frames are scored by adding the 2 rolls together, and will never = 10.
- Spare frames are when two rolls in a frame add up to 10. In this case the next roll, from the next frame is added 
to the initial frame's two rolls (i.e. Frame 1:roll 1 + Frame 1:roll 2 + Frame 2:roll3).
- Strikes are when the first roll of a frame is 10 points. In this case the next two rolls (from the next frame(s)) 
are added to the total for the score of initial strike frame. *
